Web Deployment: Flask

# 🌐 Deployment

Developed a Flask Web Application where users can input data (Income, House Age, Rooms, Bedrooms, Population) to receive instant price predictions.

Integrated model evaluation results for transparency in performance.

# 📊 Results & Insights

Achieved high accuracy across multiple models with clear benchmarking using R², RMSE, and MAE.

Ensemble and boosting methods (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM) outperformed traditional linear models.

Demonstrates the effectiveness of AI in real estate analytics for predictive decision-making.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements

Incorporate real-world datasets (e.g., Zillow, Kaggle housing datasets).

Add time-series forecasting for housing price trends.

Deploy on cloud platforms (AWS/GCP/Azure) for scalability.

Integrate a frontend UI (React/Streamlit) for better user experience.

# 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how machine learning can transform the real estate sector, offering accurate, data-driven insights for pricing decisions. By combining multiple models and deploying the solution via Flask, the system provides a practical application of AI in real-world business contexts.
